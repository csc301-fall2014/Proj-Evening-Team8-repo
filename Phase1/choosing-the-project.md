# Choosing the Project

For our project we decided to work on a messaging application for universities. We chose this project because we saw it was applicable to ourselves and would give us creative freedom. In terms of focus testing, our group consists of university students, which makes thinking about ideas and features easier as it is more relatable. It will be a web application using the Django web framework. We have decided that it will be a web application because of its cross-platform nature and given the time limit we have to work on the project, it will allow us to fully exhaust the ideas we have thought up. This is because the core features described on the handout will not take us very long to implement but expanding on these ideas and seeing them to fruition will be the major undertaking. We also decided on this project because we all would like to learn more about web development. We felt that making an Android/console application would give us too small of a user-base for the particular group of users we are trying to reach. People are more inclined to use a service if it is not just available on one medium.
