## ***REMOVED***
I'm a third year student in the computer science specialist program. I've always enjoyed designing and building things, which led me towards CS ever since writing my first lines of code in high school. Right now I'm not entirely sure of the path of computer science I'd like to pursue in the future, but I find that software engineering is the path that interests me the most. Although getting to understand SE is one of the reasons why I took this course, the main reason is that I really like working on these kinds of projects; where problem solving can be applied to create cool things. Whenever I have some free time I usually spend it on video games, watching films, and cooking. I also plan to finish developing the game I worked on over the summer whenever this busy school period is over.

## ***REMOVED***
I'm a third year student aiming for a Specialist degree in Computer Science. I hope to one day get into video game design, not only because I like playing video games (and boy do I) but because I enjoy the actual creation process. I enjoy analyzing existing video games, figuring out what makes them fun and what kinds of theories apply (such as the age old "luck versus skill"). Practically all the CS courses I've been through so far can also be related to video games, from the basics of good coding practices to user centered design (something I really want to see more of in video games).  I also tend to ramble on too much about video games. My other hobbies are drawing, writing and daydreaming about things to write and draw during boring lectures. I also enjoy taking long walks on the beach.  This paragraph has 150 words.
