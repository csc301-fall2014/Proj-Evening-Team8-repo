## ***REMOVED***
I'm a third year student aiming for a Specialist degree in Computer Science. I hope to one day get into video game design, not only because I like playing video games (and boy do I) but because I enjoy the actual creation process. I enjoy analyzing existing video games, figuring out what makes them fun and what kinds of theories apply (such as the age old "luck versus skill"). Practically all the CS courses I've been through so far can also be related to video games, from the basics of good coding practices to user centered design (something I really want to see more of in video games).  I also tend to ramble on too much about video games. My other hobbies are drawing, writing and daydreaming about things to write and draw during boring lectures. I also enjoy taking long walks on the beach.  This paragraph has 150 words.
