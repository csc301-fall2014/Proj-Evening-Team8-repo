I'm a third year student in the computer science specialist program. I've always enjoyed designing and building things, which led me towards CS ever since writing my first lines of code in high school. Right now I'm not entirely sure of the path of computer science I'd like to pursue in the future, but I find that software engineering is the path that interests me the most. Although getting to understand SE is one of the reasons why I took this course, the main reason is that I really like working on these kinds of projects; where problem solving can be applied to create cool things. Whenever I have some free time I usually spend it on video games, watching films, and cooking. I also plan to finish developing the game I worked on over the summer whenever this busy school period is over.

I'm a third year student aiming for a Specialist degree in Computer Science. I hope to one day get into video game design, not only because I like playing video games (and boy do I) but because I enjoy the actual creation process. I enjoy analyzing existing video games, figuring out what makes them fun and what kinds of theories apply (such as the age old "luck versus skill"). Practically all the CS courses I've been through so far can also be related to video games, from the basics of good coding practices to user centered design (something I really want to see more of in video games).  I also tend to ramble on too much about video games. My other hobbies are drawing, writing and daydreaming about things to write and draw during boring lectures. I also enjoy taking long walks on the beach.  This paragraph has 150 words.

I'm a third year CS student. I got into computer science due to being interested in video game development from a very young age. This is due to video games playing a huge role in my life as they kept me sane through anxieties and the like. At the start of high school I viewed CS as a means to learn programming to make video games but as I became more experienced and learnt more I found I enjoy a lot of what CS has to offer; theory/algorithms, AI, and actual software engineering. Aside from video games my interests are: painting, drawing, eating, listening to music, watching way too many movies and tv series, and shopping with friends. My favourite album at the moment is Worlds by Porter Robinson, and my favourite show right now would have to be either Gotham or Suits.

I'm a third year student in a computer science specialist post. I have always been interested in how computers actually work internally which led me to take some coding courses in highschool. I felt the type of thinking required to solve computer science problems was well suited to me and my interest has grown since taking those courses. In the summer I work for the City of Toronto on the Unix Server team which has also helped me develop an understanding of how I&T operates in a business environment. In my free time, I am usually gaming or watching sports/TV. I also enjoy going out with friends and listening to music.

I am a third year comp sci student with a focus on web/game development. I took this course because I am very interested on how teams work in software development and how efficiency and production can be maximized. I have always been into the video game scene and when I was younger I hoped to work at some big game studio but now I feel more inclined towards web dev. Entertainment is awesome and all but practical use of applications has a greater hold on me now. I have recently got super into the hackathon scene because I feel huge things are happening in that space. I wish I was at one every weekend haha. I love the support and momentum those things allow and I think I learn more during those weekends than I do months at school. Always been extremely interested in the advancements of tech in general and love the applications people are doing in the IoT space. Dream is to work in Silicon Vally someday working for some crazy startup.
