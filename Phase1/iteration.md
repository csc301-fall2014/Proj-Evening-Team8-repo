# Phase 2:
* Groups with privacy settings
* Create topics, view topics
* Topic subscription
* Account Creation (simple authentication like in a text file)
* Make Web Sexy and Ka$H$$$ KAPPA

## 3 user-stories/features/components:
* Notifications for subscriptions
  * Although it would be convenient to be notified, it isn’t necessary for viewing updates on the subscribed topic. Simple timestamps on posts can be utilized for knowing the most recent updates.
* Group moderation/administration
  * Being able to edit/delete topics within a group isn’t necessarily a core functionality of our application, and may be difficult to implement in our first release.
* Private messaging between individual users outside of forum structure
  * Already able to message between private groups through topics
 
## First iteration
* Create topics, view topics
* Account Creation (simple authentication like in a text file)
* Maybe topic subscription TBD
