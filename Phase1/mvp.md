Our project is a forum with user defined structure. It is aimed at university students and staff with the 
purpose of facilitating simple communication within various interest groups. Users are able to browse through
existing boards or create new topics that are relevant to them. Users can also subscribe to specific topics 
for the purpose of filtering out ones they are not interested in. Users are also able to restrict their topics
to specific groups in the interest of creating private discussions.  Users are able to define their own groups
rather than the groups being tied into university administration.
As an example, a student would be able to create a topic for their project group to help coordinate the team. 
They would also be able to keep tabs on topics of interest, such as textbook sales or internship opportunities.
Similarly, a professor would be able to create a topic for a class to stimulate discussion between students.
They would also be able to do things such as make announcements specific to their course, privately coordinate TAs,
or collaborate with other instructors.
From a broad standpoint, our application will allow for arbitrary divisions of the userbase based on what the users
want to discuss, and with whom. This is meant to be the defining behaviour of our application, completely separating 
it from the administration of the university or a student group.
