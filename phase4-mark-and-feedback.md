 * Would have been nice to start with a quick intro (1-3 sentences).
 * Many good features: Subscription (with UI indication), email notification, sending an email digest (to avoid spam), tagging topics (to allow convenient search), responsive design.
 * Good description of the process, and answer to the question about limiting work in progress (I am glad to hear that you did use something that didn't work well for you team).
 * Great description of the choice of tools (Django and Bootstrap), and a clear high-level explanation of what these tools are.     
   This was important, since your application's architecture was pretty much determined by the tools that you chose.
 * Overall, great job!
