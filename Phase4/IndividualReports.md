# Individual Reports

## Name (GitHub username)

Here is an example of a fake report, just to give you an idea of the format we are expecting.
We would like you to be concise yet informative.

 * My most significant contrubution was the design and implementation of Component X (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * While working on our Android app (and then later in class), I learned about adapters (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * I am always helping my teammates - I am the most experienced coder on the team, and I helped other teammates set up their development environment, and get up to speed with the tools we've used (give examples of specific tools).
 * I could keep people more informed of what I am doing - I made a few large commits that conflicted with everybody else's code, and merging everything wasted a lot of our time.

 * What is your most significant individual contribution?
 * Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
 * What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
 * What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)

 * My most significant contribution was the implementation of basic [group functionality]( https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/commit/4cb91e70930d0c8860c136188c83617cc6c87661) for our website, which has the group model, creation, and group page. This also includes group deletion and user types within the group, which was implemented in the following [commit](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/commit/2607beb28b77933f3977498d8badb64fb4f8c8d7).
 * I learned about how the model-view-controller architecture pattern works and is implemented, and also web languages like html, javascript, and css.
 * I am always available to help or meet with team members. I am a fast learner, so it doesn't take long for me to start making contributions to sections that I am inexperienced with. I also like maintaining quality, so I try to perform tests and fix bugs often.
 * I have not learned anything about web design previously, so it took me some time to become comforterable with working on our project. I don't refactor or comment my code very often so it is usually harder to understand.

 * Most of my work is relatively spread out, but the most significant standalone feature is the [registration system](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/tree/registration20) from Phase 2. Cumulatively, it would be my work on [table view](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/tree/tagsintables59) in Phase 3.
 * Throughout the project, I learned a lot about web design, going in only knowing a little about HTML. I learned about frameworks in general, MVP, and Django.
 * I had a strong grasp of the overall project and how almost every feature worked. This allowed me to assist with other member's debugging and program code that did not conflict with other features while making tweaks to existing code to improve synergy between systems.
 * I did not know javascript, forcing me to use 'hacky' implementations as seen in my work in tableview (in [views](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/blob/tagsintables59/messageboard/mainsite/views.py) and [html](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/blob/tagsintables59/messageboard/mainsite/templates/tableview.html)). Hopefully I can find time soon to brush up on it before a formal course on web design.
