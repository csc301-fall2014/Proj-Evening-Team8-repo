# Individual Reports

-----

## Name (GitHub username)

Here is an example of a fake report, just to give you an idea of the format we are expecting.
We would like you to be concise yet informative.

 * My most significant contrubution was the design and implementation of Component X (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * While working on our Android app (and then later in class), I learned about adapters (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * I am always helping my teammates - I am the most experienced coder on the team, and I helped other teammates set up their development environment, and get up to speed with the tools we've used (give examples of specific tools).
 * I could keep people more informed of what I am doing - I made a few large commits that conflicted with everybody else's code, and merging everything wasted a lot of our time.

 * Most of my work is relatively spread out, but the most significant standalone feature is the [registration system](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/tree/registration20) from Phase 2. Cumulatively, it would be my work on [table view](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/tree/tagsintables59) in Phase 3.
 * Throughout the project, I learned a lot about web design, going in only knowing a little about HTML. I learned about frameworks in general, MVP, and Django.
 * I had a strong grasp of the overall project and how almost every feature worked. This allowed me to assist with other member's debugging and program code that did not conflict with other features while making tweaks to existing code to improve synergy between systems.
 * I did not know javascript, forcing me to use 'hacky' implementations as seen in my work in tableview (in [views](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/blob/tagsintables59/messageboard/mainsite/views.py) and [html](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/blob/tagsintables59/messageboard/mainsite/templates/tableview.html)). Hopefully I can find time soon to brush up on it before a formal course on web design.
