# Individual Reports

## Name (GitHub username)

Here is an example of a fake report, just to give you an idea of the format we are expecting.
We would like you to be concise yet informative.

* My most significant contrubution was the design and implementation of Component X (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
* While working on our Android app (and then later in class), I learned about adapters (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
* I am always helping my teammates - I am the most experienced coder on the team, and I helped other teammates set up their development environment, and get up to speed with the tools we've used (give examples of specific tools).
* I could keep people more informed of what I am doing - I made a few large commits that conflicted with everybody else's code, and merging everything wasted a lot of our time.

 * My most significant individual technical contribution was the implementation of [topic subscription](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/commit/a39d8a641226ecc3f58309e94ddda519b0b412da), [subscription notifications](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/commit/768e64f1618e2cc04529aaed01cbbca1e6c2ccac), and the [enabling of external emailing for both subscriptions and account activation](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/commit/e7d26d0e1557ac3c05afe744b258f5f0b8a1c3d7)
 * While I had a little bit of experience from experimenting with another web framework (Ruby on Rails) in the past, this is my first major implementation of a web framework, so it really helped me understand some of the nuances of the MVC design pattern and really helped me understand how URL routing works.

 * My most significant contribution was the implementation of basic [group functionality]( https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/commit/4cb91e70930d0c8860c136188c83617cc6c87661) for our website, which has the group model, creation, and group page. This also includes group deletion and user types within the group, which was implemented in the following [commit](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/commit/2607beb28b77933f3977498d8badb64fb4f8c8d7).
 * I learned about how the model-view-controller architecture pattern works and is implemented, and also web languages like html, javascript, and css.
 * I am always available to help or meet with team members. I am a fast learner, so it doesn't take long for me to start making contributions to sections that I am inexperienced with. I also like maintaining quality, so I try to perform tests and fix bugs often.
 * I have not learned anything about web design previously, so it took me some time to become comforterable with working on our project. I don't refactor or comment my code very often, which is an important skill to improve on.

 * What is your most significant individual contribution?
 * Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
 * What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
 * What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)

 * Most of my work is relatively spread out, but the most significant standalone feature is the [registration system](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/tree/registration20) from Phase 2. Cumulatively, it would be my work on [table view](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/tree/tagsintables59) in Phase 3.
 * Throughout the project, I learned a lot about web design, going in only knowing a little about HTML. I learned about frameworks in general, MVP, and Django.
 * I had a strong grasp of the overall project and how almost every feature worked. This allowed me to assist with other member's debugging and program code that did not conflict with other features while making tweaks to existing code to improve synergy between systems.
 * I did not know javascript, forcing me to use 'hacky' implementations as seen in my work in tableview (in [views](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/blob/tagsintables59/messageboard/mainsite/views.py) and [html](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/blob/tagsintables59/messageboard/mainsite/templates/tableview.html)). Hopefully I can find time soon to brush up on it before a formal course on web design.

 * My most significant contribution would have to be my work with message functionality. I implemented messaging originally in [topic views](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/commits/messagetopic8), as well as [table view](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/commits/tableviewmessaging55). Later on I also added the functionality to [topics in group view](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/commits/groupmessagesfix70). There was also the scramble at the end of phase 3 [commit 1](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/commit/fb71e50ff977583a65c320f46b57c60e73fdebfc), [commit 2](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/commit/8d1f243e14d5b1019f516806fb2182c422843996), [commit 3](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team8-repo/commit/6e6c7ff4f34e4aeb6d1aa1c5d52675d44334af77) where I was able to save the project from a major reset right before the deadline.
 * The two largest technical concepts I learnt about were, MVC and web frameworks, through Django. Before the project I had never worked with a web framework, I had only done work using HTML/CSS and javascript in very small projects.
 * My ability to quickly grasp concepts. Going in to the project not knowing how Django, or more importantly web frameworks worked I was able to quickly get a hold of the basics, which then let me implement a very significant portion of the base functionality. That in turn allowed me to be a good source of knowledge for the rest of the project, with group members using parts of my original code as reference, and left me with a good intuition as to where the source of bugs were.
 * My time management was definitely my weakest point. At the start of this project, when my workload wasn't so crazy I was able to make most if not all of the meetings. As the semester went on my growing workload as well as issues in my personal life caused me to cram all of my work for the project into a short period of time, and kept me from making a meeting or two.
