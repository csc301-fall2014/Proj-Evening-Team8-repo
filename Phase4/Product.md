BadgerYard is a group discussion board aimed at university students and professors. A typical scenario that could take place within our application is if a student wants to ask a question to a specific group of students. He can make a group and invite his class to take part in discussions. Another similar scenario is that a professor could invite users to join a specific group. The student or professor can then go and post a private topic within that group for all of the members to see.


Users can register using their UTOR email and clicking on a unique link emailed to them to confirm their registration. Users can browse through public topics and can also make private topics within groups. Tags can be applied to topics which allows for easy searching when a user wants to find a specific topic.


If a user feels that a topic needs to be made they can create a new one. Additionally if a certain topic/board is very important to them they can subscribe to the topic and pull a list of all subscribed topics. All public topics are listed on the main page and sorted by subscription status and time last updated. A user can also have the option of getting email notifications when other users post messages on their subscribed topics. 


Groups are for users to keep track of different circles of peers. Groups are kept private so only those given the group password can join. Users can also invite other users to groups if they themselves are in a group. Users can message other users directly and also view their history of direct messages.
