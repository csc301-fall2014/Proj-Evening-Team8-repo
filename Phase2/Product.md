## Product Description

MessageBoard (working title) is a group discussion board aimed at university students and professors. Users can browse through created topics, ranging from class discussions to study groups to clubs, and post messages for everyone else to see. If a user makes a mistake in posting their message they are given the option to either delete or edit the message.

If a user feels that a topic needs its own board they can create a new one. Additionally if a certain topic/board is very important to them they can subscribe to the topic and pull a list of all subscribed topics.

Groups are there for users to keep track of different circles of peers, to know who to go to for certain classes or who to contact for study sessions. Groups are kept private so only those given the group name and password can join.

If users want to quickly get up to date on all things going on, they can go into the table view which shows 5 messages for each topic. Then if they see a discussion they want to contribute to they can click through and get to that topics page.
